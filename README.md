# youtube-expansion

I have created a html, css youtube clone with expansions. 
Youtube Clone Link: https://youtube-expansions.netlify.app/

The UI / UX Principles that i noticed from the actual youtube page is:
• Consistant padding
• Consistant element sizes
• Consistant whitespace between elements
• Consistant column sizes
• Consistant colors
• Visible grids for content
